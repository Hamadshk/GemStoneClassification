# GemStoneClassification
<h2>Gemstone Classification AI Model 💎✨</h2>

<p>This repository contains a sophisticated gemstone classification AI model developed using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). The model leverages the powerful feature extraction capabilities of CNNs to accurately classify various gemstones.</p>

<h3>Key Features:</h3>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Feature Extraction with CNNs</strong> 🔍📊: The beauty of CNNs lies in their ability to automatically extract important features from images, reducing the need for manual feature engineering.</li>
  <li><strong>Efficient Image Classification</strong> 📸🔠: Utilizes dense layers of neurons for effective image classification, ensuring high accuracy in distinguishing between different types of gemstones.</li>
  <li><strong>Complexity Reduction with Pooling</strong> 🧠🔄: Unlike Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) that treat every pixel with equal importance, CNNs employ pooling to reduce complexity. This technique focuses on essential features, minimizing the number of neurons and their associated weights.</li>
</ul>
